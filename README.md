## General Information
- This project is about detecting melanoma in patients using images of their skin
- In order to save time and avoid human errors, we are developing a CNN model which can detect melanoma
  in patients.
- Skin images of patients

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Initial:
- There is a little difference in training and validation accuracy. Both have not yielded a good result but the difference is also not too high.
- Training loss have a smooth trend but validation loss has a curvy trend.

Final:
- Got rid of underfitting. Although the training and validation accuracy have not changed, there is no loss in training and validation loss.
